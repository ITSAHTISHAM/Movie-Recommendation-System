# Movie Recommendation System

**Objective**

The objective of this Movie Recommendation System is to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choices. Recommender systems are widely used in various domains, including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and general products. This system aims to produce a list of recommendations using one of two methods:

Collaborative Filtering: This approach builds a model based on the user's past behavior (e.g., items purchased or searched) and similar decisions made by other users. The model predicts items or ratings for items that users may find interesting.

Content-Based Filtering: This approach utilizes discrete characteristics of an item to recommend additional items with similar properties. It relies on a description of the item and the user's preferences to make recommendations based on the user's past choices.

This project focuses on developing a basic recommendation system using Python and Pandas. The system will suggest movies that are most similar to a particular movie chosen by the user.

## Features

**Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the behavior of similar users.

**Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the characteristics of the user's favorite movies.

**Python Implementation:** Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and similarity computations.


## Tech Stack

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive exploration)


## Usage

Prepare your dataset of movies with relevant features and user interactions.

Use the provided Python scripts to clean and preprocess the data.

Run the recommendation system script to generate movie recommendations.


## Data

The dataset should include the following:

Movie titles

Movie features (genres, actors, directors, etc.)

User ratings or interactions (optional for collaborative filtering)


## Methodology

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes similarity matrices or algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to identify user preferences.

Content-Based Filtering: Leverages cosine similarity or other distance metrics to recommend similar movies.


## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with your improvements.


## Future Work

Extend the system to include hybrid filtering methods.

Integrate with a front-end application for user interaction.

Add support for large-scale datasets and real-time recommendations.
